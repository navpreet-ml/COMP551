1. For the work we have done, we are using modules (1) Pytorch, (2) Sklearn, (3) numpy and (4) matplotlib.
2. The dataset can be downloaded from (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/). Please download the file (sentence polarity dataset v1.0) which has 5331 positive and 5331 negative processed sentences / snippets.
3. Renamed the file in (sentence polarity dataset v1.0) into "pos.txt" and "neg.txt".
4. The google word2vec can be downloaded from (http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/12/googles-pretrained-word2vec-model-in-python/).
5. After putting all the files (pos.txt, neg.txt, GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin, code.py) into the same folder, the code should run without problems.
